🚦 CivicChain: Turning Traffic Fines into Civic Action
In cities like Mexico City, we all know the story: you get stopped, and instead of following the official process, you're offered a shortcut. If you decide to pay legally, the process is slow, confusing — and once your money is gone, you have no idea where it ends up.
Transparency is missing, and corruption thrives.

CivicChain doesn’t replace the official system — it transforms what happens after.

🔹 How it works:
    Pay your fine through official government channels.
    Upload your receipt to CivicChain.
    Unlock voting rights for community-led projects funded by NGOs, donors, and socially responsible partners.
    All decisions and transactions are recorded on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring full transparency.

These projects are practical and local: repainting school crosswalks, repairing sidewalks, installing proper signage.
For the first time, a traffic fine becomes more than a penalty — it becomes a tool for visible, measurable change.

👥 Who is CivicChain for?
  Drivers who want to do the right thing — and see real results.
  NGOs that demand transparency and social impact metrics.
  Communities that are tired of being excluded from decisions that affect their streets.

💡 What makes it different?
CivicChain operates without government contracts or approval.
It’s a citizen-first, decentralized, transparent platform built to scale — powered by blockchain and driven by people.
